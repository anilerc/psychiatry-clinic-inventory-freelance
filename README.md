During the pandemic, a psychiatry clinic needed a web page to digitalize their personal inventory /test processes. I solved their problem and created a web app with Vue.
The file "inventoryA.json" is left blank right now. The clinic can insert any question and its possible answer choices. I deliberately didn't create a separate database system (i.e. MongoDB) to hold inventory-answer information, as the clinic demanded a very lightweight solution. The questions and answers are hold in a JSON file.

Deployment is done on the AWS S3 service.
